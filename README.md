# Military-Grade Password Manager
### 100% Snowden-Proof!

This is a challenge I wrote for the Hushcon Seattle 2015 CTF. Participants were given an encrypted password database generated by this program, along with a copy of the source code for this program. The database contained credentials for another box on the network, where the flag resided. Only 3 of 19 teams were able to successfully complete this challenge.

**This is an intentionally-vulnerable program. Do not use it forreals.**
